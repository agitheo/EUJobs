It is composed by 3 domains:
•	Space Surveillance and Tracking (SST) of man-made objects;
•	Space WEather (SWE) monitoring and forecast;
•	Near-Earth Objects (NEO) monitoring (only natural space objects).

The EU SatCen through co-financed EC H2020 R&amp;D&amp;I actions is contributing to the current European SSA/SST activities by:
•	contributing to the implementation of the EU SST Support Framework cooperating with the SST Consortium on the provision of SST services.
•	providing recommendations on SSA governance and data policy issues;
•	facilitating the technical collaboration among SST stakeholders;

The EU SatCen is constantly seeking for spin-in between R&amp;D&amp;I activities and its operational work. As a concrete example, satellite imagery acquisition process has been enhanced by the provision of timely information of satellite over-flight opportunities through a dedicated software application benefiting from expertise acquired on SSA/SST.

Communication and Dissemination actions towards different stakeholders contribute significantly to the success of R&amp;D&amp;I activities. Related to SST, these actions are supported, among others, with the production of multimedia material and effective visualisation hardware and software tools.

Profile 1:

It is composed by 3 domains:
•	Space Surveillance and Tracking (SST) of man-made objects;
•	Space WEather (SWE) monitoring and forecast;
•	Near-Earth Objects (NEO) monitoring (only natural space objects).

The EU SatCen through co-financed EC H2020 R&amp;D&amp;I actions is contributing to the current European SSA/SST activities by:
•	contributing to the implementation of the EU SST Support Framework cooperating with the SST Consortium on the provision of SST services.

•	providing recommendations on SSA governance and data policy issues;
•	facilitating the technical collaboration among SST stakeholders;

The EU SatCen is constantly seeking for spin-in between R&amp;D&amp;I activities and its operational work. As a concrete example, satellite imagery acquisition process has been enhanced by the provision of timely information of satellite over-flight opportunities through a dedicated software application benefiting from expertise acquired on SSA/SST.

Communication and Dissemination actions towards different stakeholders contribute significantly to the success of R&amp;D&amp;I activities. Related to SST, these actions are supported, among others, with the production of multimedia material and effective visualisation hardware and software tools.
